# CURRENCY-CONVERTER-APP(Python)

## Project Overview
This project is part of the RISE Internship – Python Programming and focuses on building a simple yet functional Currency Converter Application. Currency conversion is one of the most common requirements in real life, especially for travelers, online shoppers, and professionals dealing with international markets. However, most applications are either too complex or require constant internet connectivity.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how Python can be used to create both CLI (Command-Line Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) based tools that are user-friendly and beginner-friendly. By implementing this project, learners understand conditional logic, dictionaries, user input handling, and GUI design using Tkinter.


## Features
Two versions available – CLI and GUI.

Static exchange rates are used for simplicity (USD as base).

Supported currencies: USD, INR, EUR, GBP, JPY.

CLI version takes input from the terminal.

GUI version provides dropdown menus and input fields.

Instant conversion output.

Can be extended to use real-time API rates in the future.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.13.6

Tkinter (for GUI development)


## How to Run
### 1.Run the CLI Version
python currency_converter_cli.py

### 2.Run the GUI Version
python currency_converter_gui.py

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, I gained practical experience in:

Using dictionaries to store and manage static exchange rates.

Implementing functions for modular and reusable logic.

Handling user input and validating values.

Creating an interactive GUI with Tkinter.

Understanding the importance of conditional statements and error handling.

This project not only improved my problem-solving skills but also enhanced my ability to design real-world applications in Python.

## Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time currency exchange API.

Add more global currencies.

Improve GUI with advanced styling.

Provide conversion history and logging.

Add unit tests for better reliability.

### Project completed as part of RISE Internship – Python Programming

This project highlights how simple Python concepts can be applied to solve practical problems. Both CLI and GUI versions make it flexible – beginners can start with terminal-based input, while more advanced users can explore GUI development. It is a beginner-friendly project, yet expandable to professional-level applications.
